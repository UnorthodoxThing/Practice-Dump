If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird

# standard input (StdIn)
# learn int(), modulo %, and constraints

n = int(input())
if n % 2 != 0: #Checks if integer is an odd number
    print("Weird")
elif n % 2 == 0 and 2 <= n <= 5: #checks if integer is even and in range 2-5
    print("Not Weird")
elif n % 2 == 0 and 6 <= n <= 20:
    print("Weird")
else:
